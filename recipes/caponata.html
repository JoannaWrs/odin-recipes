        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

        <li>12 green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons drained capers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss eggplant with salt and place in a colander set over a bowl. Let sit, about 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add celery; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon.</li>
